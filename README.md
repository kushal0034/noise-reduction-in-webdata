# Noise Reduction in Web Data: A Learning Approach Based on Dynamic User Interests

![Certificate](./certificate.jpg)

## 📄 Publication Overview

This research addresses a key challenge in web data usage: the overwhelming presence of noise that disrupts accurate user profiling. Traditional systems treat any non-primary web content as noise, but this work introduces a more intelligent solution — a **Noise Web Data Learning (NWDL)** algorithm that adapts to **dynamic user interests** and distinguishes between generic noise and contextually useful data.

## ✨ Key Highlights

- Proposes a novel approach to noise elimination in web user profiles based on dynamic behavioral signals.
- Leverages **web log mining** and **machine learning** to adaptively classify useful vs. noisy content.
- Enhances web personalization by identifying content users are truly interested in.

## 📌 Abstract

Current web noise reduction methods rely heavily on page structure or layout, which leads to valuable data being discarded. This paper introduces NWDL — an algorithm that filters noise by analyzing **user interaction logs** and detecting **frequent and lengthy page visits** as signals of interest. This intelligent filtering reduces loss of meaningful data and increases the relevance of personalized web profiles.

## ⚙️ Methodology

- Utilizes real-time user interaction logs (e.g., page duration, visit frequency).
- Applies **CNN, SVM, and K-Means clustering** algorithms for classifying and filtering data.
- Evaluates performance via experimental simulations, showing improved accuracy and user relevance over traditional methods.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Techniques Used

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: To extract pattern hierarchies in data.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: For supervised classification.
- **K-Means Clustering**: To group user sessions based on interest similarity.

## 📊 Experimental Results

- Developed a prototype that dynamically identifies interested vs. noise pages.
- Measured using confusion matrix, prediction accuracy, and time-depth analysis of user interaction.
- Demonstrated improved personalization through reduction in irrelevant content recommendations.
